 Nurikabe Solver by Collin Simpson and Kyle Yokiel
 Google Project: csimpson-nurikabe-solver

 
 Directory Structure:

 bin - Program binaries (executables and object code)
 CORE - Essential library of classes used for solving Nurikabe. These are not to be changed.
 DATA - Input data. Usually in the form of an unsolved Nurikabe puzzle.
 
 CS - Collin Simpson's development directory.
 KY - Kyle Yokiel's development directory.
 
 
 Development Instructions:
 
 Algorithms are to be developed in the CS and KY development directories by their
 respective owners. It may be necessary to redesign features of CORE libraries... 
 However, never  modify anything in the CORE directory. Write new libraries or sub-class 
 existing CORE classes in your development directory. If you wish to redesign 
 algorithms you do not own, copy-paste the algorithm and cite the original algorithm
 for clarity. This also makes code management easier when changes are made to the
 original algorithm(s). You might also find it useful to document your development and
 indicate dates when you make changes.
 
 Happy Coding!
